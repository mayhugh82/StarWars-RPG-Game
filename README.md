2. Your character must defeat all of the remaining fighters.

3. Click the enemy you would like to battle first.

4. Click the attack button.

5. Whenever you click attack, your character damages the defender. The opponent will lose HP (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture.
The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, your character will lose some of their HP. These points are shown at the bottom of your character's picture.

6. Continue to attack in an effort to defeat your opponent.

7. When the defender's HP is reduced to zero or below, remove the enemy from the defender area. You can now choose a new opponent.

8. You win the game by defeating all enemy characters. You lose the game if your character's HP falls to zero or below.
